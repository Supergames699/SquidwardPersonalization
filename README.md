# Squidward Personalization

Squidward help you personalize your computer! Yay



### ¿Qué?

There was a dream I had where "There was a thing in earlier versions of windows where Squidward I think would assist you in personalizing your computer and I made a video about that a long time ago Like in windows 7 and Vista"



### What's Software?

It' Made on the Visual Studio 2010, tested on the Windows 711





I held off from making this open cuz I couldn't figure out exactly how to make the "customize start menu" open directly to the Staert menu properties, as i could only make it open on the Task bar tab  But its whatever now, Soz
